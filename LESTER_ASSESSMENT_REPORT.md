## üéØ **LESTER'S FINAL VERDICT**

**"APOLLO has built a solid foundation, but it's not ready for production at 10/10 quality. The interfaces are functional and well-architected, but they need significant optimization and polish to meet the legendary standard we're aiming for."**

### **Lester's Confidence Level: 85%**
- **Interface Architecture**: 9/10 (Excellent)
- **Feature Implementation**: 8/10 (Very Good)
- **Performance**: 6/10 (Needs Work)
